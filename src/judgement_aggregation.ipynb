axial fluid in infants who develop autism spectrum disorder . prospective studies of infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder have provided important clues about the early behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum disorder . diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder , however , is not currently made until at least 18 months of age . there is substantially less research on potential brain - based differences in the period between 6 and 12 months of age . our objective in the current study was to use magnetic resonance imaging to identify any consistently observable brain anomalies in 6 - 9 month old infants who would later develop autism spectrum disorder . we conducted a prospective infant sibling study with longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans at three time points ( 6 - 9 , 12 - 15 , and 18 - 24 months of age ) , in conjunction with intensive behavioural assessments . fifty - five infants ( 33 ' high - risk ' infants having an older sibling with autism spectrum disorder and 22 ' low - risk ' infants having no relatives with autism spectrum disorder ) were imaged at 6 - 9 months ; 43 of these ( 27 high - risk and 16 low - risk ) were imaged at 12 - 15 months ; and 42 ( 26 high - risk and 16 low - risk ) were imaged again at 18 - 24 months . infants were classified as meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder , other developmental delays , or typical development at 24 months or later ( mean age at outcome : 32 . 5 months ) . compared with the other two groups , infants who developed autism spectrum disorder ( n = 10 ) had significantly greater extra - axial fluid at 6 - 9 months , which persisted and remained elevated at 12 - 15 and 18 - 24 months . extra - axial fluid is characterized by excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space , particularly over the frontal lobes . the amount of extra - axial fluid detected as early as 6 months was predictive of more severe autism spectrum disorder symptoms at the time of outcome . infants who developed autism spectrum disorder also had significantly larger total cerebral volumes at both 12 - 15 and 18 - 24 months of age . this is the first magnetic resonance imaging study to prospectively evaluate brain growth trajectories from infancy in children who develop autism spectrum disorder . the presence of excessive extra - axial fluid detected as early as 6 months and the lack of resolution by 24 months is a hitherto unreported brain anomaly in infants who later develop autism spectrum disorder . this is also the first magnetic resonance imaging evidence of brain enlargement in autism before\n","User trust:  {'User_82': 0.8755020080321285}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["         queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","14306  trip_2560  trip_4779120               1     <no ranges selected>   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","14306                  10393      1649704167  User_82   \n","\n","                                            documentText  \\\n","14306  early brain enlargement and elevated extra -

monogenic young - onset systemic lupus erythematosus . systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is a systemic , autoimmune , multisystem disease with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype . genome - wide association studies have identified multiple susceptibility loci , but these explain a fraction of the estimated heritability . this is partly because within the broad spectrum of sle are monogenic diseases that tend to cluster in patients with young age of onset , and in families . this article highlights insights into the pathogenesis of sle provided by these monogenic diseases . it examines genetic causes of complement deficiency , abnormal interferon production , and abnormalities of tolerance , resulting in monogenic sle with overlapping clinical features , autoantibodies , and shared

disorder psychopathology among individuals categorised with binge - eating disorder and bulimia nervosa . objective : while physical activity ( pa ) is known to have positive effects on psychological and physical health , little is understood about the association between non - compensatory pa ( ie , not compulsive or intended to control weight or shape ) and psychopathology among individuals with eating - disorder features . the present study explored associations between non - compensatory pa and psychopathology among adults categorised with bulimia nervosa ( bn ) and binge - eating disorder ( bed ) . we further explored the association between compensatory pa and psychopathology among those who engaged in that form of \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" purging . \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" method : participants were recruited through mechanical turk , an online recruitment platform . individuals categorised with core features of bed ( n = 138 ) and bn ( n = 138 ) completed measures of eating - disorder psychopathology ( eating disorder examination - questionnaire [ ede - q ] and questionnaire on eating and weight patterns - 5 ) , depression ( patient health questionnaire - 2 ) and pa ( both non - compensatory and compensatory , measured using the ede - q and godin leisure - time exercise questionnaire ) . results : engagement in non - compensatory pa was associated with lower frequency of binge - eating episodes , lower overvaluation of shape / weight and lower dissatisfaction with shape / weight ( ps < . 05 ) . engagement in compensatory pa was related to greater frequency of binge - eating episodes and greater restraint ( ps < . 05 ) . discussion : non - compensatory pa was associated with lower eating - disorder psychopathology . this suggests that pa is an important , though understudied , health behaviour among persons with features of bed and bn . future research should examine the potential role of non - compensatory pa in interventions for individuals with core features of these eating disorders . © 2019 john wiley & sons ltd . \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n","User trust:  {'User_14': 0.8044871794871795, 'User_145': 0.8753117206982544, 'User_103': 0.7973568281938326}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["          queryId     documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","16590  trip_37465  trip_11080980               1     <no ranges selected>   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","16590                  10869      1649617805  User_14   \n","\n","                                            documentText        queryText  \\\n","16590  \"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" associations between physica...  bulimia nervosa   \n","\n","      queryIteration  \n","16590             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-3f45bd5a-eae2-4caf-89ee-b4516e5d787f\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>16590</th>\n","      <td>trip_37465</td>\n","      <td>trip_11080980</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>&lt;no ranges selected&gt;</td>\n","      <td>10869</td>\n","      <td>1649617805</td>\n","      <td>User_14</td>\n","      <td>\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" associations between physica...</td>\n","      <td>bulimia nervosa</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-3f45bd5a-eae2-4caf-89ee-b4516e5d787f')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-3f45bd5a-eae2-4caf-89ee-b4516e5d787f button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

use of mobility protocols ; interprofessional training , education , and rounds ; and involvement of physician champions . systematic efforts to change icu culture to prioritize early mobilization using an interprofessional approach and multiple targeted strategies are important components of successfully implementing early mobility in clinical practice .\n","User trust:  {'User_100': 0.8709273182957393, 'User_143': 0.8160535117056856, 'User_149': 0.7986577181208053}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["           queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","14614  trip_269143  trip_9068104               2                   85-186   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS    userId  \\\n","14614                  45028      1649625758  User_100   \n","\n","                                            documentText  \\\n","14614  barriers and strategies for early mobilization...   \n","\n","                                    queryText queryIteration  \n","14614  early mobilization intensive care unit             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-49b903f0-0200-4a52-879d-8b0af5b0f636\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>14614</th>\n","      <td>trip_269143</td>\n","      <td>trip_9068104</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>85-186</td>\n","      <td>45028</td>\n","      <td>1649625758</td>\n","      <td>User_100</td>\n","      <td>barriers and strategies for early mobilization...</td>\n","      <td>early mobilization intensive care unit</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-49b903f0-0200-4a52-879d-8b0af5b0f636')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-49b903f0-0200-4a52-879d-8b0af5b0f636 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

specific antigen ( psa ) testing of men in uk general practice : a 10 - year longitudinal cohort study . objectives : cross - sectional studies suggest that around 6 % of men undergo prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) testing each year in uk general practice ( gp ) . this longitudinal study aims to determine the cumulative testing pattern of men over a 10 - year period and whether this testing can be considered equivalent to screening for prostate cancer ( pca ) . setting , participants and outcome measures : patient - level data on psa tests , biopsies and pca diagnoses were obtained from the uk clinical practice research datalink ( cprd ) for the years 2002 to 2011 . the cumulative risks of psa testing and of being diagnosed with pca were estimated for the 10 - year study period . associations of a man ' s age , region and index of multiple deprivation with the cumulative risk of psa testing and pca diagnosis were investigated . rates of biopsy and diagnosis , following a high test result , were compared with those from the programme of psa testing in the prostate testing for cancer and treatment ( protect ) study . results : the 10 - year risk of exposure to at least one psa test in men aged 45 to 69 years in uk gp was 39 . 2 % ( 95 % ci 39 . 0 to 39 . 4 % ) . the age - specific risks ranged from 25 . 2 % for men aged 45 - 49 years to 53 . 0 % for men aged 65 - 69 years ( p for trend < 0 . 001 ) . for those with a psa level ≥3 , a test in uk gp was less likely to result in a biopsy ( 6 % ) and / or diagnosis of pca ( 15 % ) compared with protect study participants ( 85 % and 34 % , respectively ) . conclusion : a high proportion of men aged 45 - 69 years undergo psa tests in uk gp : 39 % over a 10 - year period . a high proportion of these tests appear to be for the investigation of lower urinary tract symptoms and not screening for pca . trial registration number : isrctn20141297 , nct02044172 . © article author ( s ) ( or their employer ( s ) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article ) 2017 . all rights reserved . no commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted .\n","User trust:  {'User_100': 0.8709273182957393, 'User_112': 0.7440273037542662, 'User_33': 0.770242914979757}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["          queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","19744  trip_64590  trip_9449574               1     <no ranges selected>   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS    userId  \\\n","19744                 159310      1649659687  User_100   \n","\n","                                            documentText    queryText  \\\n","19744  prostate -

d = 1 . 32 ) . effects of barrel - sitting were not significant ( p > . 05 ; d = . 10 ) . phase ii : after 12 weeks of hippotherapy , testing in several functional domains showed improvements over baseline that were sustained for 12 weeks posttreatment . conclusions : hippotherapy can improve adductor muscle symmetry during walking and can also improve other functional motor skills .\n","User trust:  {'User_47': 0.9072256913470116}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["          queryId   documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","20323  trip_69822  trip_936782               1     <no ranges selected>   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","20323                 160000      1649710599  User_47   \n","\n","                                            documentText  \\\n","20323  immediate and long - term effects of hippother...   \n","\n","                         queryText queryIteration  \n","20323  hippotherapy cerebral palsy             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-8dd46346-7faa-4256-8a8c-202fd917c022\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>20323</th>\n","      <td>trip_69822</td>\n","      <td>trip_936782</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>&lt;no ranges selected&gt;</td>\n","      <td>160000</td>\n","      <td>1649710599</td>\n","      <td>User_47</td>\n","      <td>immediate and long - term effects of hippother...</td>\n","      <td>hippotherapy cerebral palsy</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-8dd46346-7faa-4256-8a8c-202fd917c022')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-8dd46346-7faa-4256-8a8c-202fd917c022 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

2011 ) retrieved by a systematic search in pubmed and the cochrane library , along with the us - american and canadian guidelines and additional literature retrieved by a manual search . results : of the 1383 publications retrieved by the searches , 178 were analyzed for the evidence they contained . it was concluded that the fully - developed clinical syndrome of fas should be diagnosed on the basis of the following criteria : patients must have at least one growth abnormality , e . g . , short stature , as well as all three characteristic facial abnormalities - short palpebral fissure length , a thin upper lip , and a smooth philtrum . they must also have at least one diagnosed structural or functional abnormality of the central nervous system , e . g . , microcephaly or impaired executive function . confirmation of intrauterine exposure to alcohol is not obligatory for the diagnosis . conclusion : practical , evidence - based criteria have now been established for the diagnosis of the fully - developed fas syndrome . more research is needed in order to enable uniform , evidence - based diagnostic assessment of all fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and optimize supportive measures for the children affected by them .\n","User trust:  {'User_40': 0.881243063263041, 'User_97': 0.7215686274509804, 'User_100': 0.8709273182957393}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["         queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","9849  trip_12439  trip_9577481               2                    0-144   \n","\n","      durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","9849                  57549      1649235521  User_40   \n","\n","                                           documentText  \\\n","9849  the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome . back...   \n","\n","                   queryText queryIteration  \n","9849  fetal alcohol syndrome             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-18048125-eaef-4889-bbf4-37eae3ccc4eb\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9849</th>\n","      <td>trip_12439</td>\n","      <td>trip_9577481</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0-144</td>\n","      <td>57549</td>\n","      <td>1649235521</td>\n","      <td>User_40</td>\n","      <td>the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome . back...</td>\n","      <td>fetal alcohol syndrome</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-18048125-eaef-4889-bbf4-37eae3ccc4eb')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-18048125-eaef-4889-bbf4-37eae3ccc4eb button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

stream versus later - stream urine in children undergoing bladder catheterization for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection . background : urine cultures obtained by bladder catheterization can be contaminated by bacteria colonizing the distal urethra . data are inconclusive regarding the potential advantage of discarding the first few urine drops obtained by bladder catheterization and testing only the sample of late - stream urine , thus reducing the likelihood of urine culture contamination . aim : the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the incidence of contaminated urine cultures obtained by bladder catheterization can be reduced by splitting urine samples into ' initial ' and ' late ' samples and using only ' late ' samples for culture . methods : urine samples obtained by bladder catheterization from children younger than 2 years being evaluated for urinary tract infection were prospectively collected . quantitative culture results were compared between initial - stream and late - stream urine samples . results : a total of 199 urine culture pairs of initial and late samples were compared . when using a cutoff value of at least 10 000 colony forming units / ml , late samples were superior to the initial ones in reducing contamination of urine cultures ( p = 0 . 029 ) . conclusion : when obtaining urine cultures by bladder catheterization in children younger than 2 years , discarding the first few urine drops and using only the late stream for culture reduces false - positive culture results and improves the accuracy of urinary tract infection diagnosis .\n","User trust:  {'User_95': 0.7953020134228188, 'User_50': 0.8671679197994987, 'User_140': 0.6298342541436464}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["           queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","12460  trip_184180  trip_9031834               2          189-302;633-809   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","12460                  27942      1649512176  User_95   \n","\n","                                            documentText      queryText  \\\n","12460  contamination of urinary cultures in initial -...  urine culture   \n","\n","      queryIteration  \n","12460             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-87aa50ba-bd13-4519-b08c-66b1df32d6e6\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>12460</th>\n","      <td>trip_184180</td>\n","      <td>trip_9031834</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>189-302;633-809</td>\n","      <td>27942</td>\n","      <td>1649512176</td>\n","      <td>User_95</td>\n","      <td>contamination of urinary cultures in initial -...</td>\n","      <td>urine culture</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-87aa50ba-bd13-4519-b08c-66b1df32d6e6')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-87aa50ba-bd13-4519-b08c-66b1df32d6e6 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

however , there was no significant difference between the groups at any time post operation . the frequencies of nausea in the experimental group at 2 and 6 hours post operation were lower than that in the placebo group , however , at 2 hours post operation , it was borderline significant ( p = 0 . 05 ) there was no significant differences between two group in the intensity of vomiting at any time . conclusions : use of ginger was effective at decreasing postoperative nausea . ginger could be used as a safe antiemetic drug at post operation .\n","User trust:  {'User_139': 0.7290322580645161, 'User_100': 0.8709273182957393, 'User_142': 0.6888888888888889}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["          queryId    documentId  relevanceLevel relevanceCharacterRanges  \\\n","12587  trip_18948  trip_5539069               2     <no ranges selected>   \n","\n","       durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS    userId  \\\n","12587                  34782      1649504665  User_139   \n","\n","                                            documentText  \\\n","12587  evaluation of oral ginger efficacy against pos...   \n","\n","                           queryText queryIteration  \n","12587  postoperative nausea vomiting             Q0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-d3ce6a15-6dcf-4907-8a87-a53ddcd51cc1\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>queryId</th>\n","      <th>documentId</th>\n","      <th>relevanceLevel</th>\n","      <th>relevanceCharacterRanges</th>\n","      <th>durationUsedToJudgeMs</th>\n","      <th>judgedAtUnixTS</th>\n","      <th>userId</th>\n","      <th>documentText</th>\n","      <th>queryText</th>\n","      <th>queryIteration</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>12587</th>\n","      <td>trip_18948</td>\n","      <td>trip_5539069</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>&lt;no ranges selected&gt;</td>\n","      <td>34782</td>\n","      <td>1649504665</td>\n","      <td>User_139</td>\n","      <td>evaluation of oral ginger efficacy against pos...</td>\n","      <td>postoperative nausea vomiting</td>\n","      <td>Q0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-d3ce6a15-6dcf-4907-8a87-a53ddcd51cc1')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-d3ce6a15-6dcf-4907-8a87-a53ddcd51cc1 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

[ bizhan ] despite the fact that a great deal has been said about this issue in the press , television , and on the radio , many people are still interested in it . i would like to say one more time that not a treaty but a declaration and an annex to this declaration were signed by the presidents of ukraine , the russian federation , and the united states in moscow . there are no significant discrepancies between this declaration and the supreme council resolution on ratifying the start i treaty . i would also want to emphasize that ukraine ' s nuclear disarmament issue involves the united states as well . this is exactly what we have wanted from the very beginning , when we began to address this issue . carefully looking at the annex to the statement signed by the presidents , one can see that the russian federation for the first time committed to service the nuclear warheads deployed in ukraine , and which , according to the agreement , will be gradually transferred to russia for dismantling . this is also one of the problems which we had been trying to solve , but which russia had been refusing to solve , intending to exert pressure on ukraine through this or to force it to adopt certain decisions . you know that we ourselves cannot maintain these nuclear warheads . now , one does not have to convince anybody that the nuclear weapons deployed in ukraine are our property . as you remember , one had to do this until recently , because the russian federation by no means wanted to admit that . it claimed that these weapons once belonged to the soviet union , and now they should be inherited by the russian federation . therefore , it\"\n","User trust:  {'User_32': 0.9158790170132325, 'User_75': 0.9522709776751347, 'User_70': 1.0398671096345515}\n","Final judgement:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                 queryId       documentId  relevanceLevel  \\\n","7352  rob_qq_FT941-12570  rob_FBIS3-37070               1   \n","\n","     relevanceCharacterRanges  durationUsedToJudgeMs  judgedAtUnixTS   userId  \\\n","7352     <no ranges selected>                 102345      1648925893  User_32   \n","\n","                                           documentText  \\\n","7352  \"\"\" national affairs deputy defense minister o...   \n","\n","                              queryText queryIteration  \n","7352   What is the only weapon we have?
